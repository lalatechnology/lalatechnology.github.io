### TL;DR

I was trying to find the easy and fast way to create cool looking static site. I narrows down to a few options

- GitHub Pages
- WordPress


### Start

Let's start with Theme.

Go to your admin page and select `Apearance`. You will see list of themes under `Themes` item.

If you do not like any of the provided themes, you can select `Blank Canvas` that is also a theme and customize each page as you wish.

Keep in mind most of the themes provide its own settings that allow you to customize the appearance of that theme. Usually when you switch themes, that will change a lot of settings of you page and will require additional adjustments, so be carefull. It probably better get settled down on the theme from the beginning and keep it at least for a while. You can still modify and additionally customize it with Blocks and Page Layouts. 


### Misc

Under one account you can create several static sites. That is nice.


To test the site just opne the following [link](https://mystaticsite.wordpress.com/home/) in the browser.

To administer this site you need to be logged in and the follwoing [link](https://mystaticsite.wordpress.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=2&action=edit&post_type=page&calypsoify=1&block-editor=1&frame-nonce=86d67fbc1f&origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwordpress.com&environment-id=production&support_user&_support_token) will allow you to edit the pages with WordPress editor.

Another way to make changes is to use [admin](https://wordpress.com/home/mystaticsite.wordpress.com) page of the site.

Let's see which one is for what or which way is better.

In general WordPress is pretty messy. There are several places to do eactly the same thing. For example there is `Customize` and `Menu` items in the `Admin` page. I can click on `Menu` or I can click on `Customize` and then `Menu`. Both ways will bring you to the same place where you can edit you site's `Menu`. Or you can select `Theme` with menu (and then edit it if you need more menu items).


Themes applies to the overall look of your site, while [Page Layout](https://wordpress.com/support/page-layouts/) apply to specific pages on your site. They are made of `Blocks` that could be modified using [Block editor](https://wordpress.com/support/wordpress-editor/) [like](https://mystaticsite.wordpress.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=2&action=edit).

Both `Block Patters` and [Page Layout](https://wordpress.com/support/page-layouts/) can be used to customize the layout of your pages.



#### Add Menus

[WordPress Documantation](https://wordpress.com/support/menus/)

Go to your site -> settings -> [customize](https://wordpress.com/customize/mystaticsite.wordpress.com)

Since Theme you selected may already have menu, it probably better start by selecting the Theme first.

### Hosting

It probably doesn't make sense to host your free site anywhere outside of the [WordPress.com](WordPress.com), but if your still want to explore other hosting options, Google is full of suggestions like below.
